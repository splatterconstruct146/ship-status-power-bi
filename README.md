# Ship Status - Power BI
A Power BI report for a case study I did for a vessel management company.

## Motivation
A marine vessel analytics company approached me a while back requesting for some assistance with a case study. The idea was to create appropriate report templates that could function for various managers and officers who potentially will need the vessel information. In other words an attempt to create a "one size fits all" template.

This report was created as a response.

All info seen in this report have been santized and modified. Only the approach is similar to the original copy.

## Shortcomings
Based on the info provided in the case study, the info presented here are semi-limited. Due to the generalization of the audience, the reports were kept fairly broad (i.e. each page presents a large amount of info; instead of being broken down to specifics in each page).

Also there is an emphasis on filters to allow the viewer to tweak thier desired view and data range. This can be intimidating to viewers not used to Power BI.

Lastly, the visuals used here are monotonous. They do display information in a concise manner, but visual appeal is semi-lacking. Unfortunately I do not know how to remedy this - I decided clarity of information was far more important that visual appeal.
